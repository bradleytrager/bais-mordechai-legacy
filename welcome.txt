<p>Welcome to Bais Mordechai.<br>
<br>
The hope of this site is to be educational and inspirational.<br>
<br>
I see the Torah as an instruction manual given to us by a benevolent father in heaven to help us navigate our lives, with stories and examples for us to learn from.<br>

Frogs only jump forward not backward.  So too must we continue to move forward in our quest for spirituality and contentment.</p></div>
